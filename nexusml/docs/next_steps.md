# Next Steps for NexusML Refactoring Project

Now that we've completed the documentation and examples for the NexusML
refactoring project, here are the recommended next steps:

## 1. Fix and Verify Examples

### Fix Basic Usage Example

- Register default implementations for all required components in the registry
- Add error handling for missing components
- Test with actual data files

```python
# Example fix for the basic usage example
registry.register(DataLoader, "csv", CSVDataLoader)
registry.register(DataPreprocessor, "standard", StandardPreprocessor)
registry.register(FeatureEngineer, "text", TextFeatureEngineer)
registry.register(ModelBuilder, "random_forest", RandomForestModelBuilder)

# Set default implementations
registry.set_default_implementation(DataLoader, "csv")
registry.set_default_implementation(DataPreprocessor, "standard")
registry.set_default_implementation(FeatureEngineer, "text")
registry.set_default_implementation(ModelBuilder, "random_forest")
```

### Fix Custom Components Example

- Update the example to use the actual columns in the sample data file
- Add more robust error handling for missing columns
- Create a dedicated sample data file with the expected structure

### Verify All Examples

- Run all examples with the fixes
- Ensure they complete successfully
- Document any remaining issues or limitations

## 2. Setup Jupyter Notebook Templates

### Create Experiment Notebook

Create a Jupyter notebook template for running experiments with the new
architecture:

```bash
mkdir -p nexusml/notebooks
touch nexusml/notebooks/experiment_template.ipynb
```

The notebook should include:

- Setup code for the NexusML environment
- Data loading and exploration
- Model training with different configurations
- Model evaluation and visualization
- Prediction examples

### Create Migration Notebook

Create a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates migrating from the old architecture
to the new one:

```bash
touch nexusml/notebooks/migration_example.ipynb
```

The notebook should include:

- Loading a model trained with the old architecture
- Converting it to the new architecture
- Making predictions with both architectures
- Comparing results

### Add Makefile Target for Notebooks

Add a target to the Makefile for launching Jupyter notebooks:

```bash
# Add to Makefile
nexusml-notebooks:
	jupyter notebook nexusml/notebooks/
```

## 3. Clean Up Old Files

### Identify Deprecated Files

- Create a list of files that are no longer needed
- Mark them as deprecated with comments
- Plan for their removal in a future release

### Create Migration Scripts

- Create scripts to help users migrate their data and models
- Include examples of how to convert old format files to new format

### Update Documentation

- Update documentation to reflect the deprecated files
- Provide guidance on how to migrate from old files to new ones

### Verify Dependencies

- Use the `nexusml-verify-deps` Makefile target to verify that all UV
  dependencies are up to date
- Update requirements.txt if needed
- Ensure all dependencies are properly documented

## 4. Additional Testing and Validation

### Create Integration Tests

- Create integration tests that test the entire pipeline
- Ensure all components work together correctly
- Test with different configurations and data sets

### Performance Testing

- Benchmark the new architecture against the old one
- Identify any performance bottlenecks
- Optimize critical components

### Cross-Platform Testing

- Test on different operating systems
- Test with different Python versions
- Test with different dependency versions

## 5. Documentation Improvements

### Create Video Tutorials

- Create video tutorials demonstrating the new architecture
- Include examples of common tasks
- Show how to migrate from the old architecture

### Create Interactive Documentation

- Add interactive examples to the documentation
- Allow users to try out the code directly in the browser
- Provide a sandbox environment for experimentation

### Improve API Reference

- Generate comprehensive API reference documentation
- Include examples for all methods
- Add cross-references between related components

## 6. Release Planning

### Create Release Notes

- Document all changes in the new version
- Highlight breaking changes
- Provide migration guidance

### Version Strategy

- Decide on a version number for the release
- Consider semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Plan for future releases

### Deployment Strategy

- Plan how to deploy the new version
- Consider a phased rollout
- Provide support for users during the transition

## 7. User Feedback and Iteration

### Collect User Feedback

- Set up a system for collecting user feedback
- Prioritize issues and feature requests
- Plan for iterative improvements

### Community Engagement

- Engage with the user community
- Provide support for users
- Incorporate community contributions

### Continuous Improvement

- Establish a process for continuous improvement
- Regularly review and update the codebase
- Keep documentation up to date

By following these next steps, you can ensure a smooth transition to the new
architecture and provide a great experience for users of the NexusML package.
