# NexusML Architecture Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the architecture of the NexusML package. It provides detailed information about the design, components, and interactions within the system.

## Overview

The NexusML architecture is designed around modular components with clear interfaces, dependency injection, and a factory pattern. This design enables flexibility, testability, and maintainability.

- [Pipeline](pipeline.md): Documentation for the pipeline architecture
- [Prediction](prediction.md): Documentation for the prediction process

## Key Architectural Concepts

### Component-Based Design

NexusML uses a component-based design where each component is responsible for a specific part of the machine learning pipeline. Components have clear interfaces and can be replaced or extended as needed.

### Dependency Injection

The dependency injection system provides a way to manage component dependencies, making the system more testable and maintainable. It follows the Dependency Inversion Principle from SOLID, allowing high-level modules to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

### Factory Pattern

The factory pattern is used to create components with proper dependencies. This pattern enables flexible component creation and configuration.

### Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline architecture provides a modular way to build machine learning workflows. It consists of stages that can be combined in different ways to create custom pipelines.

### Configuration-Driven Behavior

Many components are configured through configuration objects or files. This approach enables flexible configuration without code changes.

## Diagrams

The architecture documentation includes several diagrams to help visualize the system:

- Component diagrams showing the relationships between components
- Sequence diagrams showing the flow of execution
- Class diagrams showing the structure of key components

## Next Steps

After reviewing the architecture documentation, you might want to:

1. Explore the [API Reference](../api_reference.md) for detailed information on classes and methods
2. Check the [Examples](../examples/README.md) for practical usage examples
3. Read the [Usage Guide](../usage_guide.md) for comprehensive usage documentation
