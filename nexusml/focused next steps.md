# Focused next steps

# NexusML Refactoring Phase 4 Progress Note

## Completed

1. Fixed the ModelEvaluator registration in the DI container
2. Fixed the ClassificationSystemMapper issue in config_driven.py by properly handling the 'name' parameter

## Current Status

- Component resolution verification is passing
- Pipeline factory verification is passing
- Feature engineering verification is passing
- Model building verification is passing

## Relevant Files

- C:\Repos\fca-dashboard4\docs\code_review\nexusml_refactoring_phase4_testing.md
- C:\Repos\fca-dashboard4\docs\code_review\nexusml_refactoring_detailed_tasks.md

## Remaining Issues

1. End-to-end verification is failing with error: "columns are missing: {'combined_text'}"
2. Prediction pipeline verification is failing with error: "DefaultTransformerRegistry.create_transformer() got multiple values for argument 'name'"

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining ClassificationSystemMapper issue in other parts of the codebase
2. Investigate and fix the missing 'combined_text' column issue in the end-to-end test
3. Complete the remaining verification tests
4. Update documentation based on the verification results

## Files to Focus On

- nexusml/core/feature_engineering/transformers/categorical.py (ClassificationSystemMapper class)
- nexusml/core/pipeline/orchestrator.py (end-to-end pipeline execution)
- nexusml/tests/verification_script.py (verification tests)

## COmmand we are testing

```python
python -m nexusml.tests.verification_script
```
