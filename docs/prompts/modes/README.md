# NexusML Refactoring: AI Assistant Modes

This directory contains prompt templates for different AI assistant modes
tailored to the NexusML refactoring project. Each mode is designed for a
specific aspect of the project, providing specialized assistance based on the
user's needs.

## Available Modes

### Base Mode (`base_mode.md`)

The Base Mode provides general knowledge and context about the NexusML
refactoring project. It's suitable for users who need an overview of the
project, its goals, and the refactoring approach. This mode is helpful for:

- Understanding the project context
- Learning about the refactoring goals
- Getting information about the work chunks
- Discussing general concepts related to the project

### Code Mode (`code_mode.md`)

The Code Mode focuses on implementation details and coding for the NexusML
refactoring project. It's suitable for users who need help with writing code,
implementing specific components, or following best practices. This mode is
helpful for:

- Implementing specific components
- Writing tests
- Following coding best practices
- Reviewing code for quality and correctness

### Architect Mode (`architect_mode.md`)

The Architect Mode focuses on design decisions and architectural considerations
for the NexusML refactoring project. It's suitable for users who need help with
designing components, defining interfaces, or making architectural decisions.
This mode is helpful for:

- Designing component interfaces
- Making architectural decisions
- Evaluating design patterns
- Planning for extensibility and maintainability

### Ask Mode (`ask_mode.md`)

The Ask Mode focuses on answering questions about the NexusML refactoring
project. It's suitable for users who need information about specific aspects of
the project, clarification on concepts, or guidance on best practices. This mode
is helpful for:

- Getting information about specific components
- Understanding concepts related to the project
- Learning about best practices
- Finding resources for further learning

### Debug Mode (`debug_mode.md`)

The Debug Mode focuses on troubleshooting and fixing issues in the NexusML
refactoring project. It's suitable for users who are encountering errors,
performance problems, or unexpected behavior. This mode is helpful for:

- Diagnosing and fixing errors
- Troubleshooting performance issues
- Resolving integration problems
- Addressing backward compatibility challenges

## Using These Prompts

These prompt templates are designed to be used with AI assistants like Claude or
GPT. To use them:

1. Choose the appropriate mode based on your needs
2. Copy the system prompt from the corresponding file
3. Use it as the system prompt for your AI assistant
4. Provide your specific question or request as the user prompt

You can also use the example user prompts provided in each file as a starting
point for your own prompts.

## Customizing Prompts

These prompts can be customized for specific work chunks or tasks within the
NexusML refactoring project. For example, you might add specific details about
the component you're working on to the Code Mode prompt, or include information
about a particular architectural decision in the Architect Mode prompt.

## Best Practices

When using these prompts:

1. **Be specific**: Provide clear, specific information about what you need help
   with
2. **Include context**: Share relevant code snippets, error messages, or
   background information
3. **Ask focused questions**: Break down complex problems into smaller, more
   manageable questions
4. **Iterate**: Use the AI's response to refine your understanding and ask
   follow-up questions
5. **Verify**: Always verify the AI's suggestions against the project
   requirements and best practices

## Example Workflow

Here's an example workflow for using these prompts:

1. Use the Base Mode to understand the overall project and identify which work
   chunk you need to focus on
2. Use the Architect Mode to design the component interfaces and relationships
3. Use the Code Mode to implement the components
4. Use the Debug Mode to troubleshoot any issues that arise
5. Use the Ask Mode to get clarification on concepts or best practices as needed

By switching between modes as needed, you can get specialized assistance for
each aspect of the NexusML refactoring project.
