## Integration Plan

To ensure the pipeline remains functional throughout the refactoring process,
follow this integration plan:

1. **Parallel Development**: Work Chunks 1, 2, and 3 can be developed in
   parallel as they don't modify existing code.

2. **Adapter Pattern**: Work Chunks 4, 5, and 6 use adapters to maintain
   backward compatibility while introducing new components.

3. **Feature Flags**: Implement feature flags to toggle between old and new code
   paths for testing.

4. **Incremental Integration**: Integrate changes in the following order:

   - Configuration system
   - Pipeline interfaces and components
   - Factory and orchestrator
   - Entry point updates
   - Dependency injection

5. **Continuous Testing**: Run integration tests after each integration step to
   ensure functionality is maintained.
