# Work Chunk 12: Documentation and Examples

## Prompt

As the Documentation Specialist, your task is to create comprehensive
documentation and examples for the new architecture. Currently, documentation is
scattered and incomplete, making it difficult for developers to understand and
use the system. Your goal is to create clear, comprehensive documentation and
examples that help developers understand the new architecture, migrate existing
code, and create new components.

## Context

The NexusML suite has undergone significant refactoring to improve its
architecture, including:

- A unified configuration system
- Clear interfaces for pipeline components
- A dependency injection container
- A pipeline factory and orchestrator
- Updated entry points

These changes improve the system's testability, configurability, and
extensibility, but they also require comprehensive documentation to help
developers understand and use the new architecture.

## Files to Create

1. **`docs/architecture/overview.md`**

   - Contains an overview of the new architecture
   - Explains the key components and their relationships
   - Includes diagrams and examples

2. **`docs/architecture/configuration.md`**

   - Contains documentation for the configuration system
   - Explains how to configure the system
   - Includes examples of common configurations

3. **`docs/architecture/pipeline.md`**

   - Contains documentation for the pipeline architecture
   - Explains the pipeline components and their interfaces
   - Includes examples of creating custom components

4. **`docs/architecture/dependency_injection.md`**

   - Contains documentation for the dependency injection system
   - Explains how to use dependency injection
   - Includes examples of registering and resolving dependencies

5. **`docs/migration/overview.md`**

   - Contains an overview of migrating from the old architecture
   - Explains the key differences between the old and new architectures
   - Includes a migration checklist

6. **`docs/migration/configuration.md`**

   - Contains documentation for migrating configuration
   - Explains how to convert old configuration to the new format
   - Includes examples of common migration scenarios

7. **`docs/migration/components.md`**

   - Contains documentation for migrating components
   - Explains how to update components to use the new architecture
   - Includes examples of common migration scenarios

8. **`docs/examples/basic_usage.py`**

   - Contains a basic example of using the new architecture
   - Demonstrates training and prediction
   - Includes comments explaining each step

9. **`docs/examples/custom_components.py`**

   - Contains an example of creating custom components
   - Demonstrates implementing interfaces
   - Includes comments explaining each step

10. **`docs/examples/configuration.py`**

    - Contains an example of configuring the system
    - Demonstrates various configuration options
    - Includes comments explaining each option

11. **`docs/examples/dependency_injection.py`**

    - Contains an example of using dependency injection
    - Demonstrates registering and resolving dependencies
    - Includes comments explaining each step

12. **`README.md`** (update)
    - Update the main README with information about the new architecture
    - Include links to documentation and examples
    - Provide a quick start guide

## Work Hierarchy

1. **Analysis Phase**
