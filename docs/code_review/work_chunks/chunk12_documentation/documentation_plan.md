## Documentation Structure

Based on analysis of the codebase, the following documentation structure is
proposed:

### Architecture Documentation

1. **Overview (`docs/architecture/overview.md`)**

   - System architecture diagram
   - Key components and their relationships
   - Design principles (SOLID, etc.)
   - Flow of data through the system

2. **Configuration System (`docs/architecture/configuration.md`)**

   - Pydantic models for configuration
   - Configuration provider singleton
   - Environment variable integration
   - Default configuration values
   - Configuration validation

3. **Pipeline Architecture (`docs/architecture/pipeline.md`)**

   - Component interfaces
   - Component implementations
   - Pipeline factory
   - Pipeline orchestrator
   - Component registry

4. **Dependency Injection (`docs/architecture/dependency_injection.md`)**
   - DI container
   - Registration methods
   - Resolving dependencies
   - Singleton vs. transient instances
   - Factory functions

### Migration Guides

1. **Overview (`docs/migration/overview.md`)**

   - Key differences between old and new architectures
   - Migration strategy
   - Backward compatibility
   - Feature flags
   - Migration checklist

2. **Configuration Migration (`docs/migration/configuration.md`)**

   - Converting old configuration files to new format
   - Using the migration utilities
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Validation and error handling

3. **Component Migration (`docs/migration/components.md`)**
   - Updating components to use new interfaces
   - Dependency injection integration
   - Adapter pattern for backward compatibility
   - Testing migrated components

### Examples

1. **Basic Usage (`docs/examples/basic_usage.py`)**

   - Loading data
   - Training a model
   - Making predictions
   - Evaluating results

2. **Custom Components (`docs/examples/custom_components.py`)**

   - Creating custom data loaders
   - Creating custom feature engineers
   - Creating custom model builders
   - Registering custom components

3. **Configuration (`docs/examples/configuration.py`)**

   - Creating custom configurations
   - Loading configurations from files
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Configuration validation

4. **Dependency Injection (`docs/examples/dependency_injection.py`)**
   - Registering dependencies
   - Resolving dependencies
   - Creating components with dependencies
   - Using the container with the factory

## Diagrams

The following diagrams will be created to illustrate the architecture:

1. **System Architecture Diagram**

   - High-level overview of the system
   - Key components and their relationships
   - Data flow through the system

2. **Pipeline Architecture Diagram**

   - Component interfaces
   - Component implementations
   - Factory and orchestrator
   - Data flow through the pipeline

3. **Dependency Injection Diagram**

   - Container and registration
   - Resolution process
   - Component creation with dependencies

4. **Configuration System Diagram**
   - Configuration models
   - Provider singleton
   - Loading and validation process

## Implementation Approach

For each documentation file and example, the following approach will be
followed:

1. **Documentation Files**

   - Clear introduction explaining the purpose
   - Detailed explanation of concepts
   - Code examples illustrating usage
   - Diagrams where appropriate
   - Best practices and recommendations
   - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

2. **Example Files**

   - Comprehensive comments explaining each step
   - Real-world use cases
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Output examples
   - Integration with other components

3. **README Updates**
   - Overview of the new architecture
   - Quick start guide
   - Links to detailed documentation
   - Migration information
   - Example usage

## Timeline

The following timeline is proposed for completing this work:

1. **Week 1: Analysis and Design**

   - Complete analysis of the codebase
   - Design documentation structure
   - Create initial diagrams
   - Outline all documentation files

2. **Week 2: Implementation (Part 1)**

   - Implement architecture documentation
   - Implement migration guides
   - Create initial examples

3. **Week 3: Implementation (Part 2)**

   - Complete examples
   - Update README
   - Initial testing of examples

4. **Week 4: Testing and Finalization**
   - Test all examples
   - Review documentation for accuracy
   - Get feedback from developers
   - Make final adjustments
   - Final review

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining analysis tasks
2. Begin designing the documentation structure in detail
3. Create initial diagrams for the architecture
4. Start implementing the architecture overview documentation
