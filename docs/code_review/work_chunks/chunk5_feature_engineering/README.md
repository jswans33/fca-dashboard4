# Work Chunk 5: Feature Engineering Components

## Overview

This work chunk focuses on implementing the Configuration Integration for
Feature Engineering Components in the NexusML refactoring project. The goal is
to create new components that implement the pipeline interfaces from Work Chunk
2 and use the configuration system from Work Chunk 1, while ensuring the
existing code continues to work through adapter classes.

## Components Implemented

1. **Transformer Classes**

   - Created a directory structure for transformers at
     `nexusml/core/pipeline/components/transformers/`
   - Implemented 6 transformer classes following scikit-learn's transformer
     interface:
     - `TextCombiner`: Combines multiple text fields into a single field
     - `NumericCleaner`: Cleans and transforms numeric columns
     - `HierarchyBuilder`: Creates hierarchical category fields
     - `ColumnMapper`: Maps columns based on configuration
     - `KeywordClassificationMapper`: Maps keywords to classifications
     - `ClassificationSystemMapper`: Maps between different classification
       systems

2. **StandardFeatureEngineer**

   - Implemented `StandardFeatureEngineer` class in
     `nexusml/core/pipeline/components/feature_engineer.py`
   - Uses the configuration provider from Work Chunk 1
   - Builds a pipeline of transformers based on configuration
   - Implements the `FeatureEngineer` interface from Work Chunk 2
   - Provides robust error handling and logging

3. **Adapter Classes**

   - Implemented `GenericFeatureEngineerAdapter` in
     `nexusml/core/pipeline/adapters/feature_adapter.py`
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing `enhance_features()` and
     `create_hierarchical_categories()` functions
   - Delegates to the new `StandardFeatureEngineer` while preserving the
     existing API
   - Provides fallback to legacy implementation if errors occur

4. **Function Adapters**

   - Implemented `enhanced_masterformat_mapping_adapter` for backward
     compatibility with the existing function
   - Uses the configuration system for mappings
   - Provides fallback to legacy implementation if errors occur

5. **Unit Tests**

   - Created unit tests for `StandardFeatureEngineer` in
     `nexusml/tests/core/pipeline/components/test_feature_engineer.py`
   - Created unit tests for adapters in
     `nexusml/tests/core/pipeline/adapters/test_feature_adapter.py`
   - Tests cover both normal operation and fallback scenarios

6. **Example**
   - Created an example script in
     `nexusml/examples/feature_engineering_example.py`
   - Demonstrates how to use both the new components and the adapters
   - Shows how to map classifications using the new system

## Known Issues

1. **Missing Adapter Classes**: The test files are trying to import several
   adapter classes that haven't been implemented yet:

   - `LegacyDataLoaderAdapter`
   - `LegacyDataPreprocessorAdapter`
   - `LegacyFeatureEngineerAdapter` (we implemented
     `GenericFeatureEngineerAdapter` instead)
   - `LegacyModelBuilderAdapter`
   - `LegacyModelEvaluatorAdapter`
   - `LegacyModelSerializerAdapter`
   - `LegacyModelTrainerAdapter`
   - `LegacyPredictorAdapter`

   These adapters are part of other work chunks and will be implemented in those
   chunks.

2. **Renaming Needed**: We should rename `GenericFeatureEngineerAdapter` to
   `LegacyFeatureEngineerAdapter` to maintain consistency with the naming
   convention used in the tests.

## Next Steps

1. **Rename Adapter**: Rename `GenericFeatureEngineerAdapter` to
   `LegacyFeatureEngineerAdapter` to maintain consistency with the naming
   convention used in the tests.

2. **Integration with Other Components**: Integrate the feature engineering
   components with the other components as they are implemented in their
   respective work chunks.

3. **Documentation**: Add more comprehensive documentation for the feature
   engineering components, including examples of how to use them in different
   scenarios.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the performance of the feature
   engineering components, especially for large datasets.

## Usage Example

```python
from nexusml.core.config.provider import ConfigurationProvider
from nexusml.core.pipeline.components.feature_engineer import StandardFeatureEngineer
from nexusml.core.pipeline.adapters.feature_adapter import GenericFeatureEngineerAdapter

# Using the new StandardFeatureEngineer directly
config_provider = ConfigurationProvider()
feature_engineer = StandardFeatureEngineer(config_provider=config_provider)
engineered_data = feature_engineer.engineer_features(data)

# Using the adapter for backward compatibility
adapter = GenericFeatureEngineerAdapter(config_provider=config_provider)
enhanced_data = adapter.enhance_features(data)
hierarchical_data = adapter.create_hierarchical_categories(enhanced_data)
```

## Conclusion

Work Chunk 5 has successfully implemented the feature engineering components
using the new configuration system and pipeline interfaces. The components are
designed to be modular, configurable, and backward compatible with the existing
code. The next steps are to integrate these components with the other components
as they are implemented in their respective work chunks.
