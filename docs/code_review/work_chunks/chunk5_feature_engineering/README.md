# Work Chunk 5: Configuration Integration - Feature Engineering

## Prompt

As the Feature Engineering Specialist, your task is to update the feature
engineering components to use the new configuration system while maintaining
backward compatibility. Currently, the feature engineering components use
hardcoded paths, inconsistent error handling, and scattered configuration
loading. Your goal is to create new components that implement the pipeline
interfaces and use the configuration provider, while ensuring the existing code
continues to work through adapter classes.

## Context

The NexusML suite currently handles feature engineering in several places:

- `GenericFeatureEngineer` in `feature_engineering.py`
- Various transformer classes in `feature_engineering.py`
- Helper functions like `enhance_features()` and
  `create_hierarchical_categories()`

These components use hardcoded paths, inconsistent error handling, and scattered
configuration loading. This makes it difficult to:

- Test the feature engineering in isolation
- Configure the feature engineering for different scenarios
- Extend the feature engineering with new transformations

By implementing new components that use the configuration system and follow the
pipeline interfaces, we can improve testability, configurability, and
extensibility while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Files to Create

1. **`nexusml/core/pipeline/components/feature_engineer.py`**

   - Contains the `StandardFeatureEngineer` class implementing the
     `FeatureEngineer` interface
   - Uses the configuration provider for settings
   - Includes robust error handling and logging

2. **`nexusml/core/pipeline/components/transformers/`**

   - Directory for transformer classes
   - Each transformer implements a specific feature transformation
   - Uses the configuration provider for settings

3. **`nexusml/core/pipeline/adapters/feature_adapter.py`**

   - Contains adapter classes that maintain backward compatibility
   - Delegates to the new components while preserving the existing API
   - Includes documentation for migration

4. **`tests/core/pipeline/components/test_feature_engineer.py`**

   - Contains tests for the feature engineer
   - Tests various configuration scenarios
   - Tests error handling

5. **`tests/core/pipeline/components/transformers/`**

   - Directory for transformer tests
   - Tests each transformer with various inputs
   - Tests error handling

6. **`tests/core/pipeline/adapters/test_feature_adapter.py`**
   - Contains tests for the feature adapters
   - Tests backward compatibility
   - Tests integration with new components

## Work Hierarchy

   - Write integration tests with the configuration system
   - Test backward compatibility
   - Test error handling
   - Test with various feature engineering scenarios

5. **Documentation Phase**
