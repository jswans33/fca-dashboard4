# Work Chunk 3: Dependency Injection Container

## Prompt

As the Infrastructure Specialist, your task is to create a dependency injection
(DI) container system for the NexusML suite. Currently, components create their
dependencies internally, leading to tight coupling, difficulty in testing, and
limited flexibility. Your goal is to create a DI container system without
modifying existing code paths, setting the foundation for future refactoring
while ensuring backward compatibility.

## Context

The NexusML suite currently has several components that create their
dependencies internally:

- `EquipmentClassifier` creates its own `GenericFeatureEngineer` and
  `EAVManager`
- `GenericFeatureEngineer` creates its own `EAVManager`
- Various functions create their dependencies on demand

This tight coupling makes it difficult to:

- Test components in isolation
- Replace dependencies with alternative implementations
- Extend the system with new components
- Configure the system for different scenarios

By implementing a dependency injection container, we can improve testability,
extensibility, and maintainability of the codebase while adhering to the
Dependency Inversion Principle (from SOLID).

## Files to Create

1. **`nexusml/core/di/container.py`**

   - Contains the `DIContainer` class
   - Implements registration and resolution of dependencies
   - Includes support for singletons, factories, and instance registration

2. **`nexusml/core/di/provider.py`**

   - Contains the `ContainerProvider` class
   - Implements the singleton pattern for container access
   - Handles container initialization and default registrations

3. **`nexusml/core/di/decorators.py`**

   - Contains decorators for dependency injection
   - Includes `@inject` decorator for constructor injection
   - Includes `@injectable` decorator for class registration

4. **`tests/core/di/test_container.py`**

   - Contains tests for the DI container
   - Tests registration and resolution
   - Tests singleton behavior

5. **`tests/core/di/test_provider.py`**

   - Contains tests for the container provider
   - Tests singleton behavior and initialization

6. **`tests/core/di/test_decorators.py`**
   - Contains tests for the DI decorators
   - Tests decorator behavior and integration with container

## Work Hierarchy

1. **Analysis Phase**

   - Review existing dependency creation and usage
   - Identify key dependencies and their lifecycles
   - Document requirements for the DI container

2. **Design Phase**

   - Design the DI container interface
   - Design the provider interface
   - Design the decorator interfaces

3. **Implementation Phase**

   - Implement the DI container
   - Implement the container provider
   - Implement the decorators
   - Create utility functions for registration

4. **Testing Phase**

   - Write unit tests for the DI container
   - Write unit tests for the container provider
   - Write unit tests for the decorators
   - Test with various dependency scenarios

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document the DI container system
   - Create examples of using the DI container
   - Document best practices for dependency injection

## Checklist

### Analysis

## Dependencies

This work chunk has no dependencies on other chunks and can start immediately.

## Integration Points

The DI container will be used by all other components, but this chunk only
creates the container without modifying existing code. Future chunks will
integrate with this system.

## Testing Criteria

- DI container can register and resolve dependencies
- Container provider works as a singleton
- Decorators work as expected
- Unit tests for DI system pass
- No changes to existing code paths

## Definition of Done

- All checklist items are complete
- All tests pass
- Documentation is complete
- Code review has been completed
- DI container system follows SOLID principles
