# Work Chunk 8: Pipeline Orchestrator Implementation

## Prompt

As the Pipeline Integration Specialist, your task is to create a pipeline
orchestrator that coordinates the execution of pipeline components. Currently,
pipeline execution is scattered across multiple files with inconsistent error
handling and logging. Your goal is to create an orchestrator that provides a
clean API for executing the pipeline, handles errors consistently, and provides
comprehensive logging.

## Context

The NexusML suite currently executes pipeline components in several places:

- `train_model_pipeline.py` for training
- `predict.py` for prediction
- `EquipmentClassifier` methods for various operations

This scattered execution makes it difficult to:

- Ensure consistent error handling
- Provide comprehensive logging
- Configure the pipeline for different scenarios
- Extend the pipeline with new components

By implementing a pipeline orchestrator, we can centralize pipeline execution,
ensure consistent error handling and logging, and provide a clean API for
executing the pipeline.

## Files to Create

1. **`nexusml/core/pipeline/orchestrator.py`**

   - Contains the `PipelineOrchestrator` class
   - Implements methods for executing the pipeline
   - Uses the pipeline factory for component creation
   - Includes robust error handling and logging

2. **`nexusml/core/pipeline/context.py`**

   - Contains the `PipelineContext` class
   - Manages state during pipeline execution
   - Provides access to shared resources
   - Includes logging and metrics collection

3. **`tests/core/pipeline/test_orchestrator.py`**

   - Contains tests for the pipeline orchestrator
   - Tests pipeline execution
   - Tests error handling
   - Tests integration with the factory

4. **`tests/core/pipeline/test_context.py`**

   - Contains tests for the pipeline context
   - Tests state management
   - Tests resource access

5. **`examples/pipeline_orchestrator_example.py`**
   - Contains an example of using the pipeline orchestrator
   - Demonstrates training and prediction
   - Includes error handling examples
   - Shows customization options

## Work Hierarchy

1. **Analysis Phase**

   - Review existing pipeline execution
   - Identify orchestration requirements
   - Document error handling and logging requirements
   - Analyze state management needs

2. **Design Phase**

   - Design the `PipelineOrchestrator` class

   - Design orchestration methods
   - Design error handling and logging strategy

3. **Implementation Phase**

   - Implement the `PipelineContext` class
   - Implement the `PipelineOrchestrator` class
   - Implement orchestration methods
   - Implement error handling and logging

4. **Testing Phase**

   - Write unit tests for the pipeline context
   - Write unit tests for the pipeline orchestrator
   - Test with various pipeline configurations
   - Test error handling and logging

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document the pipeline orchestrator
   - Create examples of using the orchestrator
   - Document error handling and logging
   - Document integration with the factory
