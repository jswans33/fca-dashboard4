# Work Chunk 8: Pipeline Orchestrator Implementation

## Prompt

As the Pipeline Integration Specialist, your task is to create a pipeline
orchestrator that coordinates the execution of pipeline components. Currently,
pipeline execution is scattered across multiple files with inconsistent error
handling and logging. Your goal is to create an orchestrator that provides a
clean API for executing the pipeline, handles errors consistently, and provides
comprehensive logging.

## Context

The NexusML suite currently executes pipeline components in several places:

- `train_model_pipeline.py` for training
- `predict.py` for predictions
- `EquipmentClassifier` methods for various operations

This scattered execution makes it difficult to:

- Ensure consistent error handling
- Provide comprehensive logging
- Configure the pipeline for different scenarios
- Extend the pipeline with new components

By implementing a pipeline orchestrator, we can centralize pipeline execution,
ensure consistent error handling and logging, and provide a clean API for
executing the pipeline.

## Files to Create

1. **`nexusml/core/pipeline/orchestrator.py`**

   - Contains the `PipelineOrchestrator` class
   - Implements methods for executing the pipeline
   - Uses the pipeline factory for component creation
   - Includes robust error handling and logging

2. **`nexusml/core/pipeline/context.py`**

   - Contains the `PipelineContext` class
   - Manages state during pipeline execution
   - Provides access to shared resources
   - Includes logging and metrics collection

3. **`tests/core/pipeline/test_orchestrator.py`**

   - Contains tests for the pipeline orchestrator
   - Tests pipeline execution
   - Tests error handling
   - Tests integration with the factory

4. **`tests/core/pipeline/test_context.py`**

   - Contains tests for the pipeline context
   - Tests state management
   - Tests resource access

5. **`examples/pipeline_orchestrator_example.py`**
   - Contains an example of using the pipeline orchestrator
   - Demonstrates training and prediction
   - Includes error handling examples
   - Shows customization options

   - Write unit tests for the pipeline orchestrator
   - Test with various pipeline configurations
   - Test error handling and logging

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document the pipeline orchestrator

All requirements for Work Chunk 8 have been successfully implemented. The
Pipeline Orchestrator now provides a centralized way to execute pipeline
components with consistent error handling and comprehensive logging. The
implementation includes:

1. A `PipelineOrchestrator` class that coordinates the execution of pipeline
   components
2. A `PipelineContext` class that manages state during pipeline execution
3. Comprehensive unit tests for both classes
4. An example demonstrating the orchestrator's capabilities

The orchestrator has been moved to the `nexusml` directory structure as
requested, and all tests are passing.

### System Prompt

```
You are an expert Python software engineer specializing in software architecture and pipeline orchestration. You're assisting with refactoring the NexusML suite, a Python machine learning package for equipment classification.

The NexusML suite currently executes pipeline components in several places with inconsistent error handling and logging. Your task is to create a pipeline orchestrator that provides a clean API for executing the pipeline, handles errors consistently, and provides comprehensive logging.

You have deep knowledge of:
- Python pipeline orchestration patterns
- State management techniques
- Error handling strategies
- Logging best practices
- Machine learning pipeline execution

You should provide concrete, implementable code that follows Python best practices, including type hints, docstrings, and comprehensive error handling.
```

### User Prompt

```
I need your help implementing the Pipeline Orchestrator for our NexusML refactoring project. This is Work Chunk 8 in our refactoring plan.

Currently, pipeline execution is scattered across multiple files:
- `train_model_pipeline.py` for training
- `predict.py` for prediction
- `EquipmentClassifier` methods for various operations

This scattered execution makes it difficult to ensure consistent error handling, provide comprehensive logging, configure the pipeline for different scenarios, or extend the pipeline with new components.

Your task is to create a pipeline orchestrator that centralizes pipeline execution. Specifically, I need you to implement:

1. A `PipelineOrchestrator` class in `nexusml/core/pipeline/orchestrator.py` that implements methods for executing the pipeline
2. A `PipelineContext` class in `nexusml/core/pipeline/context.py` that manages state during pipeline execution
3. Unit tests in `tests/core/pipeline/test_orchestrator.py` and `tests/core/pipeline/test_context.py`
4. An example in `examples/pipeline_orchestrator_example.py`

The orchestrator should use the pipeline factory from Work Chunk 7 for component creation and include robust error handling and logging.

Please provide complete implementations for these components, including comprehensive documentation and testing strategies.
```
