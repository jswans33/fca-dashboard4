# NexusML Refactoring Work Chunks

This directory contains detailed work plans for refactoring the NexusML suite.
Each work chunk is designed to be self-contained, incremental, testable, and
efficient, allowing multiple team members to work in parallel while maintaining
pipeline functionality throughout the refactoring process.

## Overview

The refactoring is divided into 12 work chunks, each focusing on a specific
aspect of the system:

1. **Configuration System Foundation** - Create a unified configuration system
2. **Pipeline Interfaces** - Define clear interfaces for pipeline components
3. **Dependency Injection Container** - Create a DI container for component
   management
4. **Data Components** - Update data loading and preprocessing components
5. **Feature Engineering** - Update feature engineering components
6. **Model Components** - Update model building, training, and evaluation
   components
7. **Pipeline Factory** - Create a factory for instantiating pipeline components
8. **Pipeline Orchestrator** - Create an orchestrator for coordinating pipeline
   execution
9. **Training Entry Point** - Update the training pipeline entry point
10. **Prediction Entry Point** - Update the prediction pipeline entry point
11. **Dependency Injection Integration** - Update components to use dependency
    injection
12. **Documentation and Examples** - Create comprehensive documentation and
    examples

## Parallel Development

The work chunks are designed to allow parallel development:

- **Phase 1**: Work Chunks 1, 2, and 3 can be developed in parallel as they
  don't modify existing code.
- **Phase 2**: Work Chunks 4, 5, and 6 can be developed in parallel once Work
  Chunks 1 and 2 are complete.
- **Phase 3**: Work Chunk 7 can be developed once Work Chunks 4, 5, and 6 are
  complete.
- **Phase 4**: Work Chunk 8 can be developed once Work Chunk 7 is complete.
- **Phase 5**: Work Chunks 9, 10, and 11 can be developed in parallel once Work
  Chunk 8 is complete.
- **Phase 6**: Work Chunk 12 can be developed once all other work chunks are
  complete.

## Maintaining Functionality

To ensure the pipeline remains functional throughout the refactoring process,
the work chunks use several strategies:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Work Chunks 4, 5, and 6 use adapters to maintain
   backward compatibility while introducing new components.
2. **Feature Flags**: Work Chunks 9 and 10 use feature flags to toggle between
   old and new code paths for testing.
3. **Incremental Integration**: The work chunks are designed to be integrated
   incrementally, with each integration step maintaining backward compatibility.
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Each work chunk includes comprehensive testing to
   ensure functionality is maintained.

## Work Chunk Structure

Each work chunk directory contains:

- **README.md**: Detailed work plan with context, tasks, and testing criteria
- **Additional files**: Some work chunks may include additional files such as
  code snippets, diagrams, or examples

## Assignee Roles

The work chunks are designed to be assigned to team members with different
specialties:

- **Configuration System Specialist**: Work Chunk 1
- **Architecture Specialist**: Work Chunks 2 and 7
- **Infrastructure Specialist**: Work Chunks 3 and 11
- **Data Pipeline Specialist**: Work Chunk 4
- **Feature Engineering Specialist**: Work Chunk 5
- **Model Pipeline Specialist**: Work Chunk 6
- **Pipeline Integration Specialist**: Work Chunks 8, 9, and 10
- **Documentation Specialist**: Work Chunk 12

## Coordination

To coordinate work across the team, we recommend:

1. **Daily Standup**: Brief daily meetings to coordinate work and identify
   blockers.
2. **Work Chunk Handoffs**: Clear handoff criteria between dependent work
   chunks.
3. **Integration Meetings**: Scheduled meetings for integrating completed work
   chunks.
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation updated as work progresses.

## Getting Started

To get started with a work chunk:

1. Read the README.md file in the work chunk directory to understand the
   context, tasks, and testing criteria.
2. Check the dependencies to ensure they are complete.
3. Follow the work hierarchy to complete the tasks.
4. Run the tests to ensure functionality is maintained.
5. Document your work as you go.
6. Coordinate with other team members working on dependent work chunks.

## Success Criteria

The refactoring is considered successful when:

1. All tests pass with the new architecture.
2. The pipeline produces identical results with the old and new code paths.
3. The codebase adheres to SOLID principles.
4. The configuration system is unified and validated.
5. Components can be easily extended or replaced.
6. Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date.
