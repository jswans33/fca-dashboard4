# Work Chunk 1: Configuration System Foundation

## Prompt

As the Configuration System Specialist, your task is to create a unified
configuration system for the NexusML suite. Currently, configuration is
scattered across multiple files with inconsistent loading mechanisms and
hardcoded fallback values. Your goal is to create a centralized, validated
configuration system without modifying existing code paths, ensuring backward
compatibility while setting the foundation for future refactoring.

## Context

The NexusML suite currently uses multiple configuration files:

- `feature_config.yml` - Configuration for feature engineering
- `classification_config.yml` - Configuration for classification targets and
  field mappings
- `data_config.yml` - Configuration for data preprocessing
- `reference_config.yml` - Configuration for reference data sources
- `equipment_attributes.json` - Configuration for EAV structure
- `masterformat_primary.json` and `masterformat_equipment.json` - MasterFormat
  mappings

These configurations are loaded in different ways throughout the codebase, often
with hardcoded fallback values and minimal validation. This leads to fragility,
inconsistency, and difficulty in maintaining the system.

## Files to Create

1. **`nexusml/core/config/configuration.py`**

   - Contains the `NexusMLConfig` class and related configuration models
   - Uses Pydantic for validation and default values
   - Includes methods for loading and saving configuration

2. **`nexusml/core/config/provider.py`**

   - Contains the `ConfigurationProvider` class
   - Implements the singleton pattern for configuration access
   - Handles configuration initialization and resolution

3. **`nexusml/config/nexusml_config.yml`**

   - Template unified configuration file
   - Includes all settings from existing configuration files
   - Well-documented with comments explaining each setting

4. **`nexusml/core/config/migration.py`**

   - Script to migrate from existing configuration files to the new format
   - Preserves all existing settings
   - Validates the migrated configuration

5. **`tests/core/config/test_configuration.py`**

   - Unit tests for the configuration classes
   - Tests validation, loading, and saving

6. **`tests/core/config/test_provider.py`**

   - Unit tests for the configuration provider
   - Tests singleton behavior and initialization

7. **`tests/core/config/test_migration.py`**
   - Tests for the migration script
   - Ensures all settings are preserved

## Work Hierarchy

1. **Analysis Phase**

   - Review all existing configuration files and their usage
   - Document all configuration settings and their default values
   - Identify validation requirements for each setting

2. **Design Phase**

   - Design the configuration class hierarchy
   - Define validation rules and default values
   - Design the provider interface

3. **Implementation Phase**

   - Implement the configuration classes
   - Implement the provider
   - Create the template configuration file
   - Implement the migration script

4. **Testing Phase**

   - Write unit tests for all components
   - Test migration from existing configurations
   - Verify validation rules

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document the new configuration system
   - Create examples of using the new system
   - Document the migration process

## Dependencies

This work chunk has no dependencies on other chunks and can start immediately.

## Integration Points

The configuration system will be used by all other components, but this chunk
only creates the foundation without modifying existing code. Future chunks will
integrate with this system.

## Testing Criteria

- All unit tests pass
- Migration script successfully converts existing configs to new format
- Configuration validation correctly identifies invalid settings
- No changes to existing code paths

## Definition of Done

- All checklist items are complete
- All tests pass
- Documentation is complete
- Code review has been completed
- Migration script works with all existing configuration files
