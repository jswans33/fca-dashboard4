# Work Chunk 2: Pipeline Interfaces - COMPLETE

## Prompt

As the Architecture Specialist, your task is to define clear interfaces for all
pipeline components in the NexusML suite. Currently, the pipeline components
have inconsistent interfaces and are tightly coupled, making it difficult to
test, extend, or replace individual components. Your goal is to define a set of
interfaces that follow the Interface Segregation Principle (from SOLID) without
modifying existing implementations, setting the foundation for future
refactoring.

## Context

The NexusML pipeline currently consists of several key stages:

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Model building
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Prediction

These stages are implemented across multiple files with inconsistent interfaces
and tight coupling between components. This makes it difficult to test
components in isolation, extend the pipeline with new components, or replace
existing components with alternative implementations.

By defining clear interfaces for each pipeline component, we can improve
testability, extensibility, and maintainability of the codebase.

## Files to Create

1. **`nexusml/core/pipeline/interfaces.py`**

   - Contains interface definitions for all pipeline components
   - Uses abstract base classes to define contracts
   - Includes documentation for each interface

2. **`nexusml/core/pipeline/base.py`**

   - Contains base implementations of interfaces
   - Provides default behavior where appropriate
   - Includes documentation for each base class

3. **`nexusml/core/pipeline/adapters.py`**

   - Contains adapter classes that implement the interfaces but delegate to
     existing code
   - Ensures backward compatibility
   - Includes documentation for each adapter

4. **`tests/core/pipeline/test_interfaces.py`**
   - Contains tests for interface contracts
   - Ensures implementations adhere to interface contracts
   - Includes documentation for test cases

## Work Hierarchy

1. **Analysis Phase**

   - Review existing pipeline components and their interactions
   - Identify key responsibilities for each component
   - Document input and output requirements for each component

2. **Design Phase**

   - Design interface hierarchy
   - Define method signatures and documentation
   - Design adapter pattern for existing code

3. **Implementation Phase**

   - Implement interface definitions
   - Implement base classes
   - Implement adapter classes

4. **Testing Phase**

   - Write interface contract tests
   - Test adapter implementations
   - Verify backward compatibility

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document interface design decisions
   - Create examples of implementing interfaces
   - Document adapter pattern usage

## Dependencies

This work chunk has no dependencies on other chunks and can start immediately.

## Integration Points

The interfaces defined in this chunk will be used by all other components, but
this chunk only creates the interfaces without modifying existing code. Future
chunks will implement these interfaces.

## Testing Criteria

- Interface definitions are complete and well-documented
- Interface contract tests pass
- Adapter implementations pass interface contract tests
- No changes to existing code paths

## Definition of Done

- All checklist items are complete
- All tests pass
- Documentation is complete
- Code review has been completed
- Interfaces are well-defined and follow SOLID principles
