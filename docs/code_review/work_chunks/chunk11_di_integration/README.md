# Work Chunk 11: Dependency Injection Integration

## Prompt

As the Infrastructure Specialist, your task is to update the core components to
use dependency injection. Currently, components create their dependencies
internally, leading to tight coupling and difficulty in testing. Your goal is to
update the components to use the dependency injection container, making them
more testable, configurable, and extensible.

## Context

The NexusML suite currently has several components that create their
dependencies internally:

- `EquipmentClassifier` creates its own `GenericFeatureEngineer` and
  `EAVManager`
- `GenericFeatureEngineer` creates its own `EAVManager`
- Various functions create their dependencies on demand

This tight coupling makes it difficult to:

- Test components in isolation
- Replace dependencies with alternative implementations
- Configure the system for different scenarios

By updating the components to use dependency injection, we can address these
issues while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Implementation Summary

The dependency injection integration has been successfully implemented. The key
components of the implementation include:

1. **Updated Core Components**:

   - Modified `EquipmentClassifier` to accept dependencies through constructor
     parameters
   - Modified `GenericFeatureEngineer` to accept dependencies through
     constructor parameters
   - Updated functions like `enhance_features` and `predict_with_enhanced_model`
     to use the DI container

2. **Dependency Injection Decorators**:

   - Implemented `@injectable` decorator for registering classes with the DI
     container
   - Implemented `@inject` decorator for marking constructor parameters for
     injection

3. **Registration System**:

   - Created registration functions for the DI container
   - Implemented singleton management for shared components
   - Added support for custom implementations and factory functions

4. **Backward Compatibility**:

   - Maintained backward compatibility by creating dependencies internally when
     not provided
   - Added fallback mechanisms for configuration loading

5. **Testing**:
   - Created comprehensive integration tests for the DI system
   - Verified component creation through the container
   - Tested dependency resolution and backward compatibility

All components now follow the Dependency Inversion Principle, depending on
abstractions rather than concrete implementations, which makes the system more
flexible and testable.

## Implementation Details

### Dependency Injection Strategy

The dependency injection strategy implemented in this work chunk follows these
principles:

1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are injected through constructor
   parameters, making dependencies explicit and testable.
2. **Interface-Based Design**: Components depend on interfaces rather than
   concrete implementations, following the Dependency Inversion Principle.
3. **Singleton Management**: The DI container manages singleton instances for
   components that should be shared across the application.
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Components maintain backward compatibility by
   creating dependencies internally when not provided.

### Decorators

Two main decorators have been implemented:

1. **`@injectable`**: Registers a class with the DI container, making it
   available for injection.

   ```python
   @injectable
   class MyService:
       def __init__(self):
           pass
   ```

2. **`@inject`**: Marks constructor parameters for injection by the DI
   container.
   ```python
   @injectable
   class MyComponent:
       @inject
       def __init__(self, service: MyService):
           self.service = service
   ```

### Registration Functions

The registration system provides several functions:

1. **`register_core_components()`**: Registers all core components with the
   container.
2. **`register_custom_implementation(interface, implementation)`**: Registers a
   custom implementation for an interface.
3. **`register_instance(interface, instance)`**: Registers a pre-created
   instance for an interface.
4. **`register_factory(interface, factory_func)`**: Registers a factory function
   for creating instances.

### Component Updates

1. **EquipmentClassifier**:

   - Now accepts dependencies through constructor parameters
   - Falls back to creating dependencies internally when not provided
   - Uses the DI container for dependency resolution

2. **GenericFeatureEngineer**:

   - Now accepts dependencies through constructor parameters
   - Falls back to creating dependencies internally when not provided
   - Uses the DI container for dependency resolution

3. **Functions**:
   - Updated to use the DI container for dependency resolution
   - Maintain backward compatibility by accepting optional parameters

- Components can be instantiated through the DI container

- Results match the existing pipeline
- Backward compatibility is maintained

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Component with Dependencies

```python
from nexusml.core.di.decorators import injectable, inject
from nexusml.core.pipeline.interfaces import DataLoader, FeatureEngineer

@injectable
class MyComponent:
    @inject
    def __init__(self, data_loader: DataLoader, feature_engineer: FeatureEngineer):
        self.data_loader = data_loader
        self.feature_engineer = feature_engineer
```

### Resolving a Component from the Container

```python
from nexusml.core.di.provider import ContainerProvider

# Get the container
container = ContainerProvider().container

# Resolve a component
my_component = container.resolve(MyComponent)
```

### Registering a Custom Implementation

```python
from nexusml.core.di.registration import register_custom_implementation
from nexusml.core.pipeline.interfaces import DataLoader
from my_module import MyCustomDataLoader

# Register a custom implementation
register_custom_implementation(DataLoader, MyCustomDataLoader)
```

### Testing with Mock Dependencies

```python
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from nexusml.core.di.provider import ContainerProvider

# Create mock dependencies
mock_data_loader = MagicMock(spec=DataLoader)
mock_feature_engineer = MagicMock(spec=FeatureEngineer)

# Register mocks with the container
provider = ContainerProvider()
provider.register_instance(DataLoader, mock_data_loader)
provider.register_instance(FeatureEngineer, mock_feature_engineer)

# Resolve the component with mock dependencies
my_component = provider.container.resolve(MyComponent)

# Test the component
my_component.do_something()
mock_data_loader.load_data.assert_called_once()
```
