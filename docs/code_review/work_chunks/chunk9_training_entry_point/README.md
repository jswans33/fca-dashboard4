# Work Chunk 9: Entry Point Updates - Training Pipeline

## Prompt

As the Pipeline Integration Specialist, your task is to update the training
pipeline entry point to use the new architecture. Currently, the training
pipeline is implemented in `train_model_pipeline.py` with direct component
creation and execution. Your goal is to create a new version that uses the
pipeline orchestrator while maintaining backward compatibility through feature
flags.

## Context

The NexusML suite currently implements the training pipeline in
`train_model_pipeline.py`, which:

- Parses command-line arguments
- Sets up logging
- Loads reference data
- Validates training data
- Trains the model
- Saves the model
- Generates visualizations
- Makes a sample prediction

This implementation has several issues:

- Direct component creation leads to tight coupling
- Inconsistent error handling
- Limited configurability
- Difficult to test

By updating the entry point to use the pipeline orchestrator, we can address
these issues while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Files to Create

1. **`nexusml/train_model_pipeline_v2.py`**

   - Contains the updated training pipeline entry point
   - Uses the pipeline orchestrator
   - Maintains backward compatibility through feature flags
   - Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

2. **`nexusml/core/cli/training_args.py`**

   - Contains argument parsing for the training pipeline
   - Uses argparse for command-line arguments
   - Includes validation and documentation

3. **`tests/core/cli/test_training_args.py`**

   - Contains tests for argument parsing
   - Tests validation and defaults

4. **`tests/test_train_model_pipeline_v2.py`**

   - Contains tests for the updated entry point
   - Tests integration with the orchestrator
   - Tests backward compatibility

5. **`examples/training_pipeline_example.py`**
   - Contains an example of using the updated entry point
   - Demonstrates various configuration options
   - Includes error handling examples

## Work Hierarchy

1. **Analysis Phase**

   - Review existing training pipeline
   - Identify command-line arguments
   - Document backward compatibility requirements
   - Analyze error handling and logging requirements

2. **Design Phase**

   - Design the updated entry point
   - Design argument parsing
   - Design feature flags for backward compatibility
   - Design error handling and logging strategy

3. **Implementation Phase**

   - Implement argument parsing
   - Implement the updated entry point
   - Implement feature flags
   - Implement error handling and logging

4. **Testing Phase**

   - Write unit tests for argument parsing
   - Write integration tests for the updated entry point
   - Test backward compatibility
   - Test error handling and logging

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document the updated entry point
   - Create examples of using the updated entry point
   - Document command-line arguments
   - Document backward compatibility

# Work Chunk 9: Entry Point Updates - Training Pipeline Implementation

I've successfully implemented all the required components for Work Chunk 9,
which focused on updating the training pipeline entry point to use the new
architecture while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Implemented Components

1. **Updated Training Pipeline Entry Point**

   - Created `nexusml/train_model_pipeline_v2.py` that uses the pipeline
     orchestrator
   - Implemented feature flags for backward compatibility
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Ensured identical results to the old implementation

2. **Command-Line Argument Parsing**

   - Implemented `nexusml/core/cli/training_args.py` with a `TrainingArguments`
     class
   - Added validation for all arguments
   - Provided default values and documentation
   - Created utility functions for parsing and logging

3. **Unit Tests**

   - Implemented `tests/core/cli/test_training_args.py` for testing argument
     parsing
   - Implemented `tests/test_train_model_pipeline_v2.py` for testing the updated
     entry point
   - Added tests for backward compatibility and feature flags

4. **Example Usage**

   - Created `nexusml/examples/training_pipeline_example.py` demonstrating the
     updated entry point
   - Included examples of various configuration options
   - Added error handling examples

5. **Package Structure**
   - Created necessary `__init__.py` files for proper Python package structure

## Key Features

- **Backward Compatibility**: The updated entry point maintains backward
  compatibility through feature flags, allowing users to choose between the old
  and new implementations.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with specific
  exception types and detailed error messages.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed logging at appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO,
  WARNING, ERROR).
- **Configurability**: More configuration options through command-line
  arguments.
- **Testability**: Improved testability through dependency injection and clear
  interfaces.

## Architecture Improvements

The updated entry point follows SOLID principles:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Open/Closed**: The system is open for extension but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Components can be substituted with their subtypes
- **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces are specific to client needs
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions

The implementation successfully integrates with the pipeline orchestrator from
Work Chunk 8 and uses the configuration system from Work Chunk 1, demonstrating
the effectiveness of the new architecture.
