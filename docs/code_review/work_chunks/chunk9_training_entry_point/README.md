# Work Chunk 9: Entry Point Updates - Training Pipeline

## Prompt

As the Pipeline Integration Specialist, your task is to update the training
pipeline entry point to use the new architecture. Currently, the training
pipeline is implemented in `train_model_pipeline.py` with direct component
creation and execution. Your goal is to create a new version that uses the
pipeline orchestrator while maintaining backward compatibility through feature
flags.

## Context

The NexusML suite currently implements the training pipeline in
`train_model_pipeline.py`, which:

- Parses command-line arguments
- Sets up logging
- Loads reference data
- Validates training data
- Trains the model
- Saves the model
- Generates visualizations
- Makes a sample prediction

This implementation has several issues:

- Direct component creation leads to tight coupling
- Inconsistent error handling
- Limited configurability
- Difficult to test

By updating the entry point to use the pipeline orchestrator, we can address
these issues while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Files to Create

1. **`nexusml/train_model_pipeline_v2.py`**

   - Contains the updated training pipeline entry point
   - Uses the pipeline orchestrator
   - Maintains backward compatibility through feature flags
   - Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

2. **`nexusml/core/cli/training_args.py`**

   - Contains argument parsing for the training pipeline
   - Uses argparse for command-line arguments
   - Includes validation and documentation

3. **`tests/core/cli/test_training_args.py`**

   - Contains tests for argument parsing
   - Tests validation and defaults

4. **`tests/test_train_model_pipeline_v2.py`**

   - Contains tests for the updated entry point
   - Tests integration with the orchestrator
   - Tests backward compatibility

5. **`examples/training_pipeline_example.py`**
   - Contains an example of using the updated entry point
   - Demonstrates various configuration options
   - Includes error handling examples

## Work Hierarchy

1. **Analysis Phase**

   - Review existing training pipeline
   - Identify command-line arguments
   - Document backward compatibility requirements
   - Analyze error handling and logging requirements

2. **Design Phase**

   - Design the updated entry point
   - Design argument parsing
   - Design feature flags for backward compatibility
   - Design error handling and logging strategy

3. **Implementation Phase**

   - Implement argument parsing
   - Implement the updated entry point
   - Implement feature flags
   - Implement error handling and logging

4. **Testing Phase**

   - Write unit tests for argument parsing
   - Write integration tests for the updated entry point
   - Test backward compatibility
   - Test error handling and logging

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document the updated entry point
   - Create examples of using the updated entry point
   - Document command-line arguments
   - Document backward compatibility

## Dependencies

This work chunk depends on:

- Work Chunk 8: Pipeline Orchestrator Implementation

## Integration Points

- The updated entry point will use the orchestrator from Work Chunk 8
- The updated entry point will maintain backward compatibility with existing
  scripts
- The updated entry point will use the configuration system from Work Chunk 1

## Testing Criteria

- Updated entry point produces identical results to the old one
- Command-line arguments work as expected
- Feature flags correctly toggle between old and new code paths
- Error handling works as expected
- Logging is comprehensive
- Integration with the orchestrator works as expected
- Existing scripts continue to work
- Unit tests for argument parsing pass
- Integration tests for the updated entry point pass

## Definition of Done

- All checklist items are complete
- All tests pass
- Documentation is complete
- Code review has been completed
- Updated entry point follows SOLID principles
- Backward compatibility is maintained
- Examples demonstrate the updated entry point's capabilities
