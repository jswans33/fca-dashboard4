# Work Chunk 7: Pipeline Factory Implementation

## Prompt

As the Architecture Specialist, your task is to create a pipeline factory that
instantiates pipeline components with proper dependencies. Currently, components
are created in an ad-hoc manner throughout the codebase, leading to tight
coupling and difficulty in testing. Your goal is to create a factory that
centralizes component creation, leverages the dependency injection container,
and provides a clean API for creating pipeline components.

## Context

The NexusML suite currently creates components in various places:

- `EquipmentClassifier` creates its own dependencies
- `train_enhanced_model()` creates components directly
- `predict_with_enhanced_model()` creates components directly

This scattered component creation makes it difficult to:

- Test components in isolation
- Replace components with alternative implementations
- Configure the pipeline for different scenarios

By implementing a pipeline factory, we can centralize component creation,
leverage the dependency injection container, and provide a clean API for
creating pipeline components.

## Files to Create

1. **`nexusml/core/pipeline/factory.py`**

   - Contains the `PipelineFactory` class
   - Implements factory methods for all pipeline components
   - Uses the dependency injection container
   - Includes documentation for customization

2. **`nexusml/core/pipeline/registry.py`**

   - Contains the `ComponentRegistry` class
   - Manages registration of component implementations
   - Provides lookup functionality for component types

3. **`tests/core/pipeline/test_factory.py`**

   - Contains tests for the pipeline factory
   - Tests component creation
   - Tests customization

4. **`tests/core/pipeline/test_registry.py`**
   - Contains tests for the component registry
   - Tests registration and lookup

## Work Hierarchy

1. **Analysis Phase**

   - Review existing component creation
   - Identify component dependencies
   - Document factory requirements

2. **Design Phase**

   - Design the `PipelineFactory` class
   - Design the `ComponentRegistry` class
   - Design factory methods for each component type
   - Design customization mechanisms

3. **Implementation Phase**

   - Implement the `ComponentRegistry` class
   - Implement the `PipelineFactory` class
   - Implement factory methods for each component type
   - Implement customization mechanisms

4. **Testing Phase**

   - Write unit tests for the component registry
   - Write unit tests for the pipeline factory
   - Test with various component configurations
   - Test customization mechanisms

5. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document the pipeline factory
   - Create examples of using the factory
   - Document customization mechanisms
   - Document integration with the DI container

## Dependencies

This work chunk depends on:

- Work Chunk 2: Pipeline Interfaces
- Work Chunk 3: Dependency Injection Container
- Work Chunk 4: Data Components
- Work Chunk 5: Feature Engineering
- Work Chunk 6: Model Components

## Integration Points

- The factory will use the interfaces from Work Chunk 2
- The factory will use the DI container from Work Chunk 3
- The factory will create components from Work Chunks 4, 5, and 6
- The factory will be used by the orchestrator in Work Chunk 8

## Testing Criteria

- Factory can create all pipeline components
- Components are properly configured with dependencies
- Customization mechanisms work as expected
- Integration with the DI container works as expected
- Unit tests for factory pass
- No changes to existing code paths yet

## Definition of Done

- All checklist items are complete
- All tests pass
- Documentation is complete
- Code review has been completed
- Factory follows SOLID principles
- Factory provides a clean API for creating pipeline components
