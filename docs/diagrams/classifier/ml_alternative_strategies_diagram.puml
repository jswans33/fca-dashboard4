  <b>Recommended Alternatives</b>
  
  1. <b>Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)</b>
     - Often achieves higher accuracy than Random Forest
     - Better handles imbalanced equipment categories
     - Still provides feature importance
  
  2. <b>Hierarchical Classification</b>
     - Leverages natural equipment taxonomy
     - Reduces complexity of classification problem
     - More interpretable results
  
  3. <b>Word Embeddings + ML</b>
     - Better captures semantic relationships in equipment descriptions
     - Improved generalization to new equipment types
     - Can use domain-specific embeddings
  
  4. <b>Ensemble Approach</b>
     - Combine multiple models for improved accuracy
     - Reduces risk of misclassification
     - Can leverage strengths of different approaches
