## Maintenance Priorities

Maintenance organizations must be man-
aged under two constraints, limited funds
and limited manpower. I refer to these con-
straints as the Maintenance Pie. Unless the
pie can be made bigger by the infusion of
more money or labor, increasing the size of
one piece decreases the size of another.

In order for management to decide which
customer, or type of work gets the biggest
share of the resources, it is necessary to use
some type of priority system. Frequently,
this decision is left to the maintenance su-
pervisor. A simple system of three priorities
is often used. "A" work carries the highest
priority, "B" the next highest, and so on.

Unfortunately, this type of priority system
is not usually a system at all, and "the wheel
that squeaks the loudest often gets the most
grease". Decisions are not made objectively,
and maintenance suffers.

A priority system that overcomes these
deficiencies was developed and copyrighted
in 1964 by Albert Ramond and Associates,
Inc., a Chicago consulting firm; it is called
the RIME system. RIME, which stands for
the Ranking Index for Maintenance Expendi-
tures, is relatively complicated and cumber-
some to use in all but large organizations.
Ramond modified the system, however, into
a simplified version that I have used suc-
cessfully for several years.

The RIME system consists of two factors,
the ranking of each piece of equipment, and
the classification of each type of mainte-
nance job. Each Equipment Type and Job
Class is ranked on a scale of one to ten.
Ten carrying the highest priority. These de-
cisions are made by maintenance and pro-
duction management when the system is im-
plemented, and usually only changed when
equipment or functional priorities of the fa-
cility are changed

An example of an "Equipment
Ranking" and "Job Classification" index is
shown in Figures 1 and 2. These have been
revised slightly from the original Ramond
version and were used successfully in a me-
dium-size food plant.

### EQUIPMENT RANKING

| Rank | Description of Equipment |
|------|---------------------------|
| 10   | Safety Equipment with a safety hazard. Includes personnel and food safety Utilities equipment affecting several production lines. Includes boilers, compressors, etc |
| 9    | Utilities |
| 8    | Key Production No stand-by equipment available; will shut down an entire line. In- cludes fryers, case packers, etc. |
| 7    | Multiple Production Equipment Units for which standby equipment is available, shuts down part of a line. Includes extruders, packaging machines, etc |
| 6    | Key Matl. Handling Equipment No stand-by units available, no alternative method of moving prod- uct. Includes conveyors, etc. |
| 5    | Multiple Mat'l Handling Equipment Stand-by units available, alternative method for moving product exists. Includes forklifts, hand jacks, etc. |
| 4    | Support Equipment Includes all support units, such as shop equipment, office equipment, waste handling equipment, etc. |
| 3    | Bldg. & Grounds Includes cafeteria, offices, wash rooms, parking lots, etc. |

### JOB CLASSIFICATIONS

| Class | Description of Work |
|-------|---------------------|
| 10    | Real Safety, Critical Food Safety Critical safety work where life or limb is in danger. Actual product contamination. Work is an emer- gency. Call maintenance. |
| 9     | Breakdown, Poor Quality Equipment or process failure. Major potential problem, breakdown is near. Items causing production loss or poor quality in an emergency. |
| 8     | Preventive Maintenance Inspections, lubrication, and re- pairs to auto lubricators or alarm systems. Work to prevent break- downs or repair work. |
| 7     | Service Work, Serious Food Safety Necessary work during operating periods. Potential for product contamination. |
| 6     | Spares, Corrective Maintenance Work on spare parts or units, no additional spares. Corrective main- tenance to reduce repetitive work |
| 5     | Shutdown Work Necessary shutdown work, including safety work not critical enough to warrant immediate shutdown. |
| 4     | Routine Work, Normal Safety Work on spare parts or units, nor- mal maintenance, including routine safety work. |
| 3     | Product Or Quality Improvement Necessary work to improve quality or quantity of production, main- tenance or materials handling. |
| 2     | Cost Reduction Cost reduction work not falling in- to one of the higher classes |
| 1     | Janitorial, Maintenance Painting, Housekeeping Keeping locker rooms and lavatory facilities operable. Protective painting to prevent rust. |

In order to determine work order priority,
the equipment rank and job class is deter-
mined and these two factors multiplied to-

gether to give a priority number, with 100
being the highest available. Since the index
will not always provide the correct priority,
however, maintenance supervisors must
have authority to change priority. Explana-
tions for deviations must be required or the
system will soon fail.

Some notes: 1) Any equipment with a
safety hazard receives an equipment rank of
10. 2) Job class 10 is never used on a nor-
mal work order; this is reserved for critical
safety items that warrant an emergency
maintenance call. 3) A system should be
used that increases the RIME after a work
order is a given age, i.e., thirty days. This
will help ensure that low priority work or-
ders eventually get completed.

Some type of priority system must be used
in any successful maintenance organization.
The RIME system, in this simplified version,
is easy to use and addresses the shortcom-
ings of other systems. I have experimented
with many priority systems during the previ-
ous fifteen years and have always returned
to the RIME index. It works!

## Effective Maintenance Organizations

There is no single formula for success.
This is especially true for an effective main-
tenance organization. There are, however,
common elements that are a part of every
effective maintenance program: 1) clear,
challenging objectives; 2) an accurate inven-
tory control program; 3) an up-to-date pre-
ventive maintenance (PM) program; 4) a
work order (WO) control system; 5) infor-
mation systems for documentation, progress
measurement, and training.

When building an effective maintenance
organization the first step is developing key
objectives. These objectives should include
regulatory compliance, training, cost control,
capital funding, PM, and customer relation-
ships. Objectives can be developed and pre-
sented as business goals or treated as a char-
ter to a mission statement. The key is to use
objectives as a communication tool to con-
vey organization direction and focus to the
entire plant.

The inventory focus should be critical
spare parts. These are items that are not
readily available and could cause downtime
in excess of an acceptable amount. Many
managers stock "one of everything" so when
it breaks they have a spare. This should be
a conscience decision as you do not want
your stock room to become the "local hard-
ware store." It is more cost effective to in-
