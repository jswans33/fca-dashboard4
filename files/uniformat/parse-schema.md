Hereâ€™s a structured JSON schema template that you can use to upload your
UniFormat PDF to Llama Parse to extract relevant data for classification
purposes:

### JSON Schema for UniFormat Data Extraction

```json
{
  "UniFormat": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "Sections": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "Number": { "type": "string" },
            "Title": { "type": "string" },
            "MasterFormat_Number": { "type": "string" },
            "Explanation": { "type": "string" },
            "Includes": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
            "Performance_Requirements": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": { "type": "string" }
            },
            "Subsections": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "Number": { "type": "string" },
                  "Title": { "type": "string" },
                  "MasterFormat_Number": { "type": "string" },
                  "Includes": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": { "type": "string" }
                  },
                  "Performance_Requirements": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": { "type": "string" }
                  }
                },
                "required": ["Number", "Title"]
              }
            }
          },
          "required": ["Number", "Title"]
        }
      }
    },
    "required": ["Sections"]
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Schema:

- **Sections**: Represents each major section from the UniFormat document.
  - **Number**: UniFormat code number (e.g., D1010.10).
  - **Title**: Description or title of the section (e.g., Elevators).
  - **MasterFormat_Number**: Corresponding MasterFormat number.
  - **Explanation**: Additional details from the section.
  - **Includes**: List of items explicitly mentioned within the section.
  - **Performance_Requirements**: References to performance requirements if
    mentioned.
  - **Subsections**: Further granularity of the classification, structured
    similarly to the main sections.

### How to Use this Schema:

1. **Llama Parse Setup**:

   - Upload this schema to Llama Parse.
   - Set it to extract content from the provided PDF, adhering to this schema.

2. **Data Extraction**:

   - Run extraction on your PDFs (like the one you uploaded).
   - The output JSON will give you structured data ready for database ingestion
     or further processing.

3. **Integration**:
   - Load the structured JSON into your data model (e.g., using Python with
     Pandas).
   - Use it to classify equipment or as a reference lookup.

This structure ensures you accurately capture all critical classification
elements to utilize the model effectively.

The prompts you've set are quite clear, but here's how you could slightly
enhance them for precision:

### Improved Model Prompts:

**System Prompt:**

```
Output the provided content formatted as a complete LaTeX document, including necessary preamble and structure.
```

**Append to System Prompt:**

```
Do not format headings as titles. Instead, prefix headings explicitly with "TITLE:" followed by the heading text.
```

**User Prompt:**

```
Also, translate the entire content into French.
```

This setup ensures clarity on exactly what the model should produce and how it
should handle titles explicitly.
